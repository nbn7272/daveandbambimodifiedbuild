These are all the Bambi FLAs I can find. 
They've all been updated due to some of the symbols messing up and what not. 
The FLAs for the dialogue sprites and stuff like the PDNs for older Bambi sprites I don't have. 
I also hid a few easter eggs and secrets so have fun I guess. I made all the Bambi stuff when I first got Adobe Animate so expect it to be a bit odd in some places.
But yeah that's all, have fun messing with them.
