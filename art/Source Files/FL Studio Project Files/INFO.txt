Furiosity is missing due to me losing it, sorry
For Bambi's vocals just open Slicex and add break_phone.ogg from the Dave files
Bambi's samples for Splitathon are included in the Samples folder, simply open Fruity Slicer (not slicex) and drag them in

Plugins required to load these songs properly:
Boyfriend DirectWave Instrument: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zzrk9QplR9zu3mCDbfIy-IVKAIF5g6rS/view?usp=sharing
EZdrummer 2 (Used in Insanity and Splitathon, uses a whole gigabyte of memory so make sure your pc can handle that)
Serum (Used in Corntheft for those heavy leads you hear)
reFX Nexus (Used in Corntheft for basses and pads)
Kontakt Loader + Orchestral Essentials (Used in maze for the staccato backing)
Valhalla DSP Pack (Used in unfairness for that weird bitcrush effect on the drums, also used in maze for the snares)

Samples for songs will be included
